    <h3> Assignment 08 - Arrays and Looping </h3>

    <h4>3 questions for this assignment:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make an Array of strings and assign it to a variable. You may make the strings a list of anything you like
            and
            use a variable name of your choice.</li>
        <li>
            Use one of the methods of the Array object to insert a new element to the beginning of your array.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the Array you made in the previous steps, iterate over its elements and write each one to the
            console.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <script>
        // Insert your code for question 1 here
        var animals = ["dog", "cat", "elephant", "pinguin", "octapus"];



        // Insert your code for question 2 here
        animals.unshift("parrot");
        alert(animals);
        // Insert your code for question 3 here

        for (i = 0; i <= animals.length; i++) { console.log(animals[i]) };
